        Brute force solution:
        1. Find all the permutation of nums and sort it ascending order
        2. The next greater permutation is the next arr that is in the sorted container 
        However, this approach is bad in terms of time efficient since it can take up yo O(n!) time complexity.

        Solution: The problem lies on how to determine the next permutation of the curr array. 
            - The edge case is when we have a decreasing arr like [5, 4, 3, 2] -> next: permutation is [2, 3, 4, 5]

                + In other word, find a[i] and a[i - 1] such that a[i] > a[i- 1]from the right. Now, no rearrangements to the right of a[iâˆ’1] can create a larger permutation since that subarray consists of numbers in descending order.
