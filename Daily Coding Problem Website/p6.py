"""
This is your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As always, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day!
